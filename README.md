# Auto Cleaning and Formatting python repo

This repo contains multiple CI/CD GitHub Action-based workflow tests to keep python repositories clean and high quality

After any push:
- A 'code-cleaner' GitHub action runs automatically
- It performs various cleaning and formatting steps
- Automatically push the files affected by those steps

List of performed steps (in-order of execution):

### 1. Cleaning ipynb Notebook Outputs üßº
This way, the notebooks are always clean and the output cells are not included!
- Cleaning is performed via [nbconvert library](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert)

### 2. Auto Formatting in PEP8 üèóÔ∏è
Any python file is modified and made PEP8-compliant!
- It uses the [autoyapf open-source library](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/autoyapf)
- ‚ùå TODO: Doesn't work on ipynb python cells!?!
- ‚ùå TODO: Let it run on all notebooks in the repo

#### How to test:
- Modify or create a python script (not compliant with PEP8) and run the notebook to produce some outputs
- Push
- Wait for GitHub action to run
- Look at your beautiful quality code üçÉ
